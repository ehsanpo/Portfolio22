Flamman ungdomarnas hus is a youth recreation center in Malmö, Sweden. I was my self a member of the Flamman when I was young. Over the years the organization has grown substantially and still operates a recreation center for youths ages 13-20. I hold some workshop with the communications manager and staff to find out what they needed to make the site. I did both the design and the development of the site.
