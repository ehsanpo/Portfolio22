We received a Graphic Profile and a style guide in Sketch format by Mekonomen. Worked together in an agile team where I was responsible for the entire project together with a front end/UX and a Backend developer. After we went live, I took care of the maintenance of the site, Bug fix and also the Mekonomen servers (Stage &amp; Prod) / RHEL.
