The mission was to move the old Soctanter site to a new platform (Drupal forum). But in the pre-studies of the project, we had the chance to meet with moderators who worked on the website and felt how difficult it would be for them to use a forum. After some meeting with those responsible for the Soctanter, we were assigned to developing a new platform that users could use to submit questions and moderators got to answer them. Also, the backend was built so that Soctanter who were to work could have all the features they needed.
