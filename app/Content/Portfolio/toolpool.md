Malmö Hardware Store needed an idea to be able to compete with the giant home improvement chains that are taking over the market. We learned that the stores’ main earnings come from supplies, not from expensive tools. So we created ToolPool. It works just like a carpool, but with tools. And it’s for free. All we ask for in return is that you share our message on Facebook.During the very first month, ToolPool received extensive media coverage, over 600 members and sales in the store increased by 25%.
