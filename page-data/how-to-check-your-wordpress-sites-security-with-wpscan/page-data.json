The best option is to choose an administrator username which consists of random characters and use a different nickname. WPScan scans for usernames in the URL’s so if you won’t use the username it cannot be scanned by WPScan. Another way to prevent user enumeration is to use a different account to publish posts and answer to replies.</p>\n<h3>How to avoid Wordpres password brute forcing</h3>\n<p>The best way to keep attackers using brute force methods out is to limit the login attempts for and IP address. There are several plug-ins available for WordPress to limit the number login attempts for a specific username and IP, such as Wordfence. The latest WordPress versions have the option to limit login attempts by default. Make sure you limit entries to a maximum of 3 and increase lock out time a lot after 2 lock outs (which is 6 password attempts).</p>","frontmatter":{"permalink":"/how-to-check-your-wordpress-sites-security-with-wpscan","title":"How to check your wordpress sites security with WPScan","tag":["security","Wordpress"],"category":["Lab"]}}},"pageContext":{"pathSlug":"/how-to-check-your-wordpress-sites-security-with-wpscan","permalink":"/how-to-check-your-wordpress-sites-security-with-wpscan","previous":{"frontmatter":{"permalink":"/what-is-twitch","title":"What is Twitch?"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"permalink":"/wordpress-malware-keeps-coming-back","title":"WordPress malware keeps coming back"}},"id":"88392c92-1685-5d93-8c27-0e851184c19e"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
